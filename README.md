# React + Vite

This is my CapStone for little-lemon. The coursera API provided DID NOT WORK. IT DOESNT WORK. I needed to build an API from scratch so there is an API.js file in this project that houses it.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
