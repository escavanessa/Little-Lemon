# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is the coursera capstone project. A reservation system for the Little Lemon Restaurant. What a ride this was. i had to recruit professional help because the API that coursera so gratiously provided did not work. I could not access any of the data so i had to build a data structure (forgive me if my termonology is a bit wonky here - i want to go into Front end, not Back end. We used an object to store some basic data on bookins including how many there are available for specific dates. For the breadth of the project, we decided on only three or four dates. after building the data structure we were then able to create some functionality that not only updated the back end to reflect when a certain date was 'no longer available' but we were also able to create a confirmation page that gives the user all the information they chose for the reservation. If the API had worked, a lot of my energy and effort could have gone to creating a more meaningful from end expereince but having to build the data structure was very time consuming and a lot of trouble shooting had to be done between me and the person who was helping me to make sure we were making the right choices for the project. All in all, i learned so much and im grateful for my friends help.
